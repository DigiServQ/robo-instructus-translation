Robo Instructus Translations
============================
Translations for programming puzzle game Robo Instructus.

## About
As a solo dev with limited resources I may not be able to fund many (or even any) professional translations of the game.
However, I'd love for the game to be available to anyone that wants to play it even if the economics disagree. This project exists to provide a way for open source community translations built on machine translations to be used in game.

## Want to help?
If you are multilingual and want to improve the game for your language(s) then please do. Checkout the `en-replace.LANGUAGE.pairs` files and improve the translations that are there.

If you'd like to see support for a new language please raise an issue.

## Test
`cargo test --all --all-features`
